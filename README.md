# TorngenPythonClient
`TorngenPythonClient` is an autogenerated Python library containing the paths and schemas required to make requests against the [Torn API v2](https://www.torn.com/swagger/index.html) and parse the responses.

## Installation
This library is intended to be installed from GitHub to allow developers to update the generated OpenAPI-related code regardless of the maintenance of projects depending upon this library.

For example, this can be done using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):
```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/Tornium/torngen_python_client.git
```

## Basic Usage
1. Create an implementation of the [`HTTPAdapater`](#HTTPAdapter) to perform API calls and any custom API-related behavior.
2. Perform the query:
    - Select a resource from the [path documentation](https://tornium.github.io/torngen_python_client/torngen/path.html).
    - Determine the selections to use.
    - Determine the parameters to use for those selections.

**Example:**
```py
from torngen_python_client.path import User

response = (
    User()
    .select(User.attacks, User.bounties)
    .limit(10)
    .get(adapter=CustomHTTPClient)
    .parse()
)
```

3. Access query response:
After being parsed, each selection's parsed response can be selected by accessing the response dictionary by the selection name.

**Example:**
```py
for attack in response.attacks:
    print(f"{attack.defender.name} was attacked")
```

Consult the [documentation](https://tornium.github.io/torngen_python_client/) (and the [path documentation](https://tornium.github.io/torngen_python_client/torngen/path.html)) for information on available endpoints and parameters. For detailed API usage and available endpoints, refer to the Torn API [Swagger documentation](https://www.torn.com/swagger/index.html) and the generated source code in this repository.
